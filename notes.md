# Things we could do

**Antimirov**:
- continue [Michael Greenberg's investigation](https://www.weaselhat.com/post-819.html) into the size of Brzozowski derivatives, but apply them to Antimirov instead
- given a regex `r`, the number of Antimirov word derivatives is linear in the size of `r` (source)
- Up to similarity, the union of the set of Antimirov partial derivatives of a regular expression and the Brzozowski derivative are the same.
- see https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41939/time-complexity-of-derivative-based-regex-matchers

**Zippers**
- In his PhD dissertation, Romain Edelmann proves that Brzozowski derivatives are finite by representing them as zippers (he also has a [Coq development here](https://github.com/epfl-lara/silex-proofs/tree/master))
- ^^ perhaps this is another way to prove that Brzozowski is finite?
